'''maxcut.py: A simple implementation using CVXPY of Goemans-Williamson
algorithm for Max-Cut problem of finding a maximum cut of a graph:
  Goemans and Williamson. Improved approximation algorithms for maximum cut and
  satisfiability problems using semidefinite programming. J. ACM, 42(6):1115â€“1145, 1995.
  http://www-math.mit.edu/~goemans/PAPERS/maxcut-jacm.pdf

Algorithm is randomized and returns a random subset S, but with guarantee on S:
    cut-size(S) > 0.878 * max-cut-size

Example. For a cycle on 5 vertices [0, 1, 2, 3, 4] we get:
  Chosen subset: [1 4]
  Cut size: 4
  Edges of the cut: [(0, 1), (1, 2), (3, 4), (0, 4)]

    ## Define the graph
    n = 5
    edges = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (0, 4)]

    ## Define SDP Relaxation and solve it
    x = gw(n, edges)

    ## Find the edges of a cut
    xcut = cut(x, edges)

    ## Result
